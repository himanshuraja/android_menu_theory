D) What is the alternative of ActionBarActivity as its deprecated?

Ans. Since the version 22.1.0, the class ActionBarActivity is deprecated.  Its deprecation is just a hint for us asking to use new AppCompatActivity directly instead. AppCompatActivity is a new, more generic implementation which uses AppCompatDelegate class internally.
If we start a new development, then we should rather use new AppCompatActivity class right away. If we have a chance to update your app, then replace deprecated ActionBarActivity by the new activity as well. Otherwise we can stay with deprecated activity and there will be no difference in behavior at all.
Regarding AppCompatDelegate, it allows us to have new tinted widgets in an activity, which is neither AppCompatActivity nor ActionBarActivity.
